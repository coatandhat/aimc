#summary AIM-C simple data file format.

The module [http://code.google.com/p/aimc/source/browse/trunk/src/Modules/Output/FileOutputAIMC.cc FileOutputAIMC] provides data in a simple format which can be read by other programs. 

The data is stored as 32-bit floats with the native byte-ordering of the machine the file was written on. Before the data, there is a simple header.

== Header format == 
The first 20 bytes of the file contain the following fields:

32-bit unsigned integer: frame_count
32-bit float: frame_period_ms
32-bit unsigned integer: channel_count
32-bit unsigned integer buffer_length
32-bit float: sample_rate



== Reading the files using MATLAB ==
Use [http://code.google.com/p/aimc/source/browse/trunk/matlab/AIMCread.m the MATLAB AIMCread function] to read the files.
