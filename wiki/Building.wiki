#summary Building AIM-C
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

AIM-C is built using the [http://www.scons.org/ SCons] build system. SCons is multiplatform, and is based on Python. 

= Build Environment =
One of the major requirements of AIM-C is that it is written, as far as possible, in standard C++ (including some heavy dependence on the standard template library). This means that (in theory at least) it will compile under any reasonably sane C++ compiler. In practice, so far development has taken place mainly using GCC on Mac OS 10.6.

= External Dependencies =
Current dependencies are [http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ libsndfile] and [http://cairographics.org cairo] for audio input and graphics output respectively. [http://www.portaudio.com/ PortAudio] is a requirement for live audio input. This will be ported over soon. The boost c++ extensions are also required for the module that adds noise to the input.

On Ubuntu, the necessary build tools and dependencies can be installed using the following command.

{{{
sudo apt-get install libsndfile-dev cairo-dev 
}}}

The project also uses [http://code.jellycan.com/simpleini/ simpleini] version 4.12 for storing, parsing and writing out parameters files, but this file (and the UTF support code that it requires) is included in the source repository. 

= Build Tools =
== Building ==

Assuming SCons is installed,  to build the source tree simply navigate to the top level of the source tree (where the SConstruct file resides) and issue the command:

`scons`

== Getting SCons ==
On GNU/Linux systems, either use your favourite package manager to install scons, for example on Debian / Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install scons`

On Mac OS X, I'd recommend using MacPorts. It's a handy way of installing all sorts of free software. First install MacPorts, then run the command:

`sudo port install scons`

Alternatively, in either case, you can just download and install a tarball from the [http://www.scons.org/ SCons site].
