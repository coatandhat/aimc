#summary AIM-C design document
#labels Phase-Design

= Requirements =
  * Accurate implementation of various key parts of the Auditory Image Model:
    ** Filterbanks: Gammatone, dcGC, PZFC
    ** NAP: HCL, 2DAT
    ** Strobes: sf1992 and sf2003 main algorithms
    ** SAI: ti2003 algorithm
    ** Features: Gaussian features
 * Fast. AIM-C should be as fast as possible at processing audio
 * Easy to test. Developers writing new modules should have an easy way to test them, and should be encouraged to submit tests with their code.
