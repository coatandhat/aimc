The bash scripts in this directory are incomplete. spoke_point.sh serves as
a method of getting arbitrary spoke points, and 
generate_train_test_scripts.sh is an incomplete method of generating training
and testing scripts. However, they don't yet include a way of getting at the
central speaker, or of creating random sets of syllables, so they're left here
for historical value.

The canonical spoke points are generated using the MATLAB function
get_spoke_points..m
