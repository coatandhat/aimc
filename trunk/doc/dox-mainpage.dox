\mainpage AIM-C developer documentation

AIM-C is a real-time version of the the auditory image model (AIM)
developed at the <a href="http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/groups/cnbh/">
Centre for the Neural Basis of Hearing</a>.

AIM-C uses a block-based processing scheme. A mono input signal is
split into short segments, which are sequentially 'pushed' through the
processing pipeline. The pipeline consists of a number of modules in a
tree structure.

The basic unit of data in AIM-C is the signal bank, and the basic
processing unit is the module. A signal bank represents a short
segment, or 'frame', of an audio signal with multiple
channels. Modules generally take a frame (represented as a signal
bank) as input, and generate zero, one, or more signal bank frames as
output. Each module is linked to a set of 'target' modules, to which
they 'push' the frames which they generate. Each of these modules
performs processing on the output of the previous module, and in turn,
push the output that they produce to their targets.

This feed-forward, tree-like system allows modules to retain the internal
state required for processing

Coding style

For the most part, AIM-C now follows the <a
href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml">
Google C++ style guide</a>. The original (2006-2009) AIM-C codebase
used a different style, and so you may find some files which still
follow the older conventions. New code should adhere to the Google style
guide.
