## AIM-C ##

AIM-C is a C++ version of the auditory image model (AIM). AIM is a computational model of the human auditory system.

AIM was originally developed by Roy Patterson, and is documented in various publications including Patterson et al. (1995).

This version of the code was originally witten by Tom Walters, with contributions from Willem van Engen, and was used for the experiments detailed in Walters (2011) and Monaghan et al. (2010).
